# This is the configuration file for Ghostty.
#
# This template file has been automatically created at the following
# path since Ghostty couldn't find any existing config files on your system:
#
#   /home/epost/.config/ghostty/config
#
# The template does not set any default options, since Ghostty ships
# with sensible defaults for all options. Users should only need to set
# options that they want to change from the default.
#
# Run `ghostty +show-config --default --docs` to view a list of
# all available config options and their default values.
#
# Additionally, each config option is also explained in detail
# on Ghostty's website, at https://ghostty.org/docs/config.

# Config syntax crash course
# ==========================
# # The config file consists of simple key-value pairs,
# # separated by equals signs.
# font-family = Iosevka
# window-padding-x = 2
#
# # Spacing around the equals sign does not matter.
# # All of these are identical:
# key=value
# key= value
# key =value
# key = value
#
# # Any line beginning with a # is a comment. It's not possible to put
# # a comment after a config option, since it would be interpreted as a
# # part of the value. For example, this will have a value of "#123abc":
# background = #123abc
#
# # Empty values are used to reset config keys to default.
# key =
#
# # Some config options have unique syntaxes for their value,
# # which is explained in the docs for that config option.
# # Just for example:
# resize-overlay-duration = 4s 200ms

# Start ghostty maximized
maximize = 1

# Custom keybindings
# Rebind new tab to Ctrl+T (overriding default Ctrl+Shift+T) and unbind old binding.
# Use explicit unbind action so default is removed and key passes through (transpose-char unavailable).
keybind = ctrl+shift+t=unbind
keybind = ctrl+t=new_tab

maximize = true

# Tab switching: use Ctrl+<number> instead of Alt+<number>.
# Unbind the default Alt+number bindings first.
keybind = alt+one=unbind
keybind = alt+two=unbind
keybind = alt+three=unbind
keybind = alt+four=unbind
keybind = alt+five=unbind
keybind = alt+six=unbind
keybind = alt+seven=unbind
keybind = alt+eight=unbind
keybind = alt+nine=unbind

# New bindings using ctrl+<number> (numeric keys must be written as words in triggers internally,
# but Ghostty output will normalize them; using digits here is accepted for actions referencing tabs.)
keybind = ctrl+1=goto_tab:1
keybind = ctrl+2=goto_tab:2
keybind = ctrl+3=goto_tab:3
keybind = ctrl+4=goto_tab:4
keybind = ctrl+5=goto_tab:5
keybind = ctrl+6=goto_tab:6
keybind = ctrl+7=goto_tab:7
keybind = ctrl+8=goto_tab:8
keybind = ctrl+9=last_tab
