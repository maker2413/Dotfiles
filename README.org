These are personal configurations for the tools I use on a daily basis. Feel
free to use or modify them in anyway. On most of my machines I run arch linux
and normally I just use the new ~arch-install~ utility. On my laptop however I
run artix linux, which if you have never heard of it it is arch linux with
~systemd~ stripped out. You can check my installation guide for artix here:
[[./docs/artix_install.org][docs]].

* Bootstrapping
  I boot strap all of my systems after they have been installed using a tool
  that I created called [[https://github.com/maker2413/yacm][yacm]] or Yet Another Configuration Manager. I'm not going
  to go into the details of yacm here, but you can see all of my system's
  profiles: [[./yacm/profiles/][here]].
